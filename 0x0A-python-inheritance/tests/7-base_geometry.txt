The ``BaseGeometry`` model
==========================


Using the ``BaseGeometry`` model
----------------------------------

Import model from:
    >>> BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry


Test for object creation:
    >>> bg = BaseGeometry()
    >>> type(bg)
    <class '7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry'>

Test for correct instance:
    >>> bg = BaseGeometry()
    >>> isinstance(bg, BaseGeometry)
    True

Test for area method through obj:
    >>> bg = BaseGeometry()
    >>> bg.area()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    Exception: area() is not implemented

Test for area method is an instance method:
    >>> type(bg.__dict__['area'])
